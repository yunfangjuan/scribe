# Reddit Scribe Setup Example
#

# Before you start, read the following docs first
# https://github.com/facebook/scribe/wiki/Scribe-Overview 
# https://github.com/facebook/scribe/wiki/Scribe-Configuration

# The following  shows you how to log messages between multiple Scribe instances.a
# It's a model similar to what we will implement for reddit. 
# In this example, we will run each Scribe server on a different port to simulate
# running Scribe on multiple machines. The "client" in practice is the scribe server
# instance co-located with web/tracking server. The "central" is the scribe server
# instance that will run on a different machine and buckets the incoming messages 
# into multiple files. Note that the 'client' is a 'buffer' store which has a 
# 'primary' setting to send the data over the network and a 'secondary' setting 
# to spool the data on a temporary file if the network is down. The message will be
# resent if once the network is backed up.

                                      |
                                   -------------------
                                   | /tmp/scribetest/ |
                                   -------------------
# Each scribe log entry consists of two components: category and message. 
# In the scribe configuration file, you specify how to handle messages by category.
# If you don't have a configuration for a specific category, the config of categoy 'default' 
# will be used. 

# You can find a very good scribe client example in examples/scribe_cat where it has the client
# code you will put in your python code to log the messages.

# Given reddit's scale, I think we definitely want to bucket the log messages. If you setup
# a bucket store, by default they will hash the first column of the message and modulo it to 
# a bucket number and write them to different files. Typically people bucket the data by userids
 

# Now back to the configuration, the 'client' configuration  is really simple. All it does is to
# forward the data to another server and buffer the data is the remote server is not available. 
# Note that in production, the remote_host for the primary setting can be a domain name behind
# a vips, so the messages can be forward to multiple machines to scale up.

# The 'central' configuration is more complicated as we want to bucket the data and 
# rotate the data regularly. In the following example, we will bucket data from 
# category 'reddit_test' by hashing the first column delimited by ':', modulo by 32 and 
# append the data into one of the 32 files. The file will also be rotated every 5 minutes. 
# The non reddit_test category data will be forwarded to the default category

mkdir /tmp/scribetest
mkdir /tmp/scribetest2

# start the scribe servers
scribed reddit_central.conf 
scribed reddit_client.conf 

# test is with scribe_cat

# the following eventually writes to /tmp/scribetest/xzy unbucketted
echo 'hello world' | ~/scribe/examples/scribe_cat -h localhost:1464 xyz
# the following writes to bucket 0 /tmp/scribetest/reddit_test000/ip-10-232-14-81/
echo 'hello world' | ./scribe_cat -h localhost:1464 reddit_test
# the following writes to bucket 003 (hash from '2')
echo '2:hello world bucket xxsdfdsf' | ~/scribe/examples/scribe_cat -h localhost:1464 reddit_test
